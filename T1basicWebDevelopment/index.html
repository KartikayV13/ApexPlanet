            <p> â€¢ Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet <br> (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network). Web development can range from <br> developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, <br> electronic businesses, and social network services. <br> A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, <br> may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison,  <br>client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, <br> and e-commerce development.
                <br>
                The World Wide Web, the foundation of modern web development, was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. He also developed the first web browser and editor, and proposed the initial standards for HTML, HTTP, and URLs.
